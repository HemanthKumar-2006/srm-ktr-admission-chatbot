## 1. Terminology

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Entity** | A node in the graph representing a real-world SRMIST concept |
| **Relationship** | A directed link between two entities |
| **Seed data** | Hardcoded entities/relationships that form the stable skeleton of the graph |
| **Dynamic data** | Entities and relationships discovered by scraping the SRMIST website |
| **Cross-link** | A relationship that connects an entity to more than one parent (e.g., Housing appears under both Facilities and Campus Life) |
| **Slug** | URL-safe identifier derived from a name, e.g., `faculty-of-engineering-technology` |

---

## 2. Entity Types

Every entity must have exactly one `entity_type` from the table below.

| Type | Tag | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `university` | 🟣 | Top-level institution root. There is only **one** university node. | SRMIST |
| `campus` | 🟠 | A physical campus of SRMIST. | Kattankulathur |
| `college` | 🔴 | A Faculty / College at the top of a campus's academic structure. Despite some being called "School" (e.g., SRM School of Law), they still use the `college` type. | Faculty of Engineering & Technology |
| `school` | 🟥 | An intermediate grouping of departments *within* a college (e.g., under FET) | School of Computing |
| `sub_college` | 🩷 | A college **within** the Medicine & Health Sciences college only. | College of Dentistry |
| `department` | 🟢 | A Department or Centre-of-study under a college or sub-college. | Dept of Computer Science |
| `centre` | 🩵 | A research or service centre. May be cross-linked to multiple parents (college + directorate). | CACR |
| `directorate` | 🟡 | An administrative directorate or division at campus level. | Directorate of Research |
| `program` | 🟡 | A degree / course offered by a department. | B.Tech Computer Science |
| `facility` | 🟢 | A physical / operational campus service. NOT academic. | Housing, Transport, SRM Hotels |
| `admission` | 🔵 | An admission process portal (India or International). | Admissions — India |
| `publication` | 🟣 | Publications, achievements, or faculty gateway sections. | Publications |
| `misc` | ⚫ | Utility / informational pages that do not fit above categories. | News & Events, Blog, About |

### Rules

- A node's `entity_type` must **never** change once assigned. To reclassify, remove and recreate.
- `sub_college` is **only** used for the 7 immediate children of Medicine & Health Sciences.
- Directorates like "Directorate of Career Centre" are `directorate`, **not** `facility`.
- "Career Development Centres" inside departments (linked to Career Centre directorate) are `centre`.
- `misc` is a catch-all — use it sparingly.

---

## 3. Relation Types

Every relationship must have a `relation_type` from this table.

| Relation | Direction | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `has_campus` | university → campus | SRMIST has a campus |
| `has_college` | campus → college | A campus has a college/faculty |
| `has_sub_college` | college → sub_college | Medicine has sub-colleges |
| `has_department` | college / sub_college / directorate → department | Has a department |
| `has_centre` | college / department / directorate → centre | Has a research/service centre |
| `has_directorate` | campus → directorate | Campus has an administrative directorate |
| `has_facility` | campus → facility | Campus has a physical facility |
| `offers_program` | department → program | Department offers a degree program |
| `has_admission` | university / campus → admission | University/campus has an admission node |
| `admission_governs` | admission → program | Admission portal governs a program's intake |
| `collaborates_with` | centre / program / event / lab ↔ centre / program / event / lab | Collaboration only between lower-order entities |
| `also_listed_under` | centre / facility / misc / publication → directorate / section / college / department | Cross-listing when a node is discoverable from multiple contexts but should keep one canonical home |
| `belongs_to` | department / centre → college | Reverse of has_department / has_centre (for lookup) |

### Rules

- Relationships are **directed**. The source is always the "parent" or "owner" unless noted.
- `also_listed_under` must **never** replace the primary `has_*` link. Always add both.
- Do not create `has_department` from `university` or `campus` directly — always go through a `college`.
- `admission_governs` links an `admission` node to specific `program` nodes (not to departments).
- Do not create `collaborates_with` between `directorate`, `college`, or `department`.
- If two higher-order entities are connected through a shared centre, lab, event, or program, that collaboration is **derived**, not stored as a direct edge.

Note: within Medicine & Health Sciences, only College of Medicine, College of Dentistry, and College of Pharmacy keep seeded child departments. College of Physiotherapy, College of Occupational Therapy, College of Nursing, and School of Public Health are modeled as college-cum-department units, while Medicine and Dentistry department grouping is captured in `attributes.type`.

---

## 5. Naming Conventions

### Entity Names
- Always spell out the **full official name** — no abbreviations in names.
  - ✅ `Faculty of Engineering & Technology`
  - ❌ `FET`, `Engg & Tech`
- Use `&` not `and` where the official name uses `&`.
- Title-case all entity names.
- Department names must include "Department of" prefix where official.
  - ✅ `Department of Computer Science and Engineering`
  - ❌ `Computer Science`

### Entity IDs (Slugs)
IDs are auto-generated as `{type}--{slug}` where slug is lowercase, spaces → hyphens, & → and, special chars stripped.
- `university--srmist`
- `campus--kattankulathur`
- `college--faculty-of-engineering-and-technology`
- `department--department-of-computer-science-and-engineering`
- `directorate--directorate-of-research`

### Programs
- Include the degree prefix: `B.Tech`, `M.Tech`, `M.B.B.S`, `Ph.D`
- Include specialisation: `B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering`

---

## 6. Seeded (Hardcoded) Data

The following data is defined as constants in `knowledge_graph.py` under `SEED_*` variables. These form the **skeleton** of the graph and are always present regardless of what the scraper finds.

### Why Seed?
- The SRMIST website structure is not consistent enough to reliably auto-discover the top-level hierarchy.
- Seeds ensure the graph is always correct at the macro level.
- Dynamic (scraped) data is layered on top of seeds.

### Seed Categories
1. University root entity
2. Campus entities + `has_campus` links
3. KTR college entities + `has_college` links from KTR
4. Medicine sub-college entities + `has_sub_college` links from Medicine
   - Only Medicine, Dentistry, and Pharmacy keep seeded child departments.
   - Medicine and Dentistry department grouping lives in `attributes.type`; existing `attributes.category` is retained where already present.
5. KTR directorate entities + `has_directorate` links from KTR
6. KTR facility entities + `has_facility` links from KTR
7. Admission nodes + `has_admission` links
8. Cross-links (`also_listed_under`)
9. Misc nodes
10. Rule-based overrides for structurally inconsistent sections such as Directorate of Research

> ⚠️ When adding a new college, department, or directorate that is **known** to always exist, add it to the seed constants first, then verify it also comes through scraping.

---

## 7. Dynamic (Scraped) Data

The scraper populates:
- **Department entities** from `/department/{slug}/` URLs
- **College entities** from `/college/{slug}/` URLs (merged with seeds by ID)
- **Program entities** from `/program/{slug}/` URLs
- **Centre entities** from `/centre/{slug}/` or `/centers/{slug}/` URLs
- **HODs** from content parsing (`_HOD_PATTERN`)
- **Deans** from content parsing (`_DEAN_PATTERN`)
- **Chairpersons** from content parsing (`_CHAIRPERSON_PATTERN`)
- **Relationships** from `internal_links` metadata of each scraped page

### What Changes Over Time (Dynamic)
- HOD / Dean / Chairperson names
- Program names, fees, eligibility criteria (stored as `program.attributes`)
- New departments or centres being added
- New faculty/staff (not stored in KG — too granular)

### What Almost Never Changes (Stable Seeds)
- University, campuses, top-level colleges
- Medicine sub-colleges
- Core directorates
- Naming conventions
- Canonical ownership rules for Directorate of Research centres

---

## 8. Cross-Link Rules

Cross-links use the `also_listed_under` relation type. They are always **in addition to** the primary `has_*` relationship.

| Entity | Primary Parent (`has_*`) | Also Listed Under |
|---|---|---|
| Housing | campus (via `has_facility`) | Campus Life section |
| Transport | campus (via `has_facility`) | Campus Life section |
| International Hostel | Housing facility | International Students section |
| Research Centres in colleges | college (via `has_centre`) | Directorate of Research |
| Career Development Centres in depts | department (via `has_centre`) | Directorate of Career Centre |
| Controller of Examinations | campus (via `has_directorate`) | Admissions — India node |

### Directorate of Research Override

The SRMIST website mixes Research content across `/research/`, `/department/`, event pages, and college pages. To keep rebuilds stable:

- The following are treated as the **core centres associated with Directorate of Research**:
  - IIISM, REACH, NRC, CACR, SRM-DBT Platform, Medical Research Centre (aMRC), Centre for Statistics, EQRC/ERC, HPCC, SCIF
- If one of the above centres is explicitly listed under a college or department, that academic unit should be the **primary** parent via `has_centre`.
- In that case, Directorate of Research must become the **secondary** parent via `also_listed_under`.
- If a centre appears only in Research context and no academic owner is known, Directorate of Research may remain the primary `has_centre` parent.
- Add `also_listed_under` for every additional surfaced context that matters beyond the primary owner.
- Do not add direct `collaborates_with` edges from Directorate of Research to colleges or departments. Any such relationship must be inferred from shared lower-order entities.
- Research governance and archive pages such as R&D Cell, University Research Council, Projects, Sponsored Projects, SERI, Publications, Patents, Ph.D Awarded, and DPRC must map to stable canonical entities even if their URLs are not under `/directorate/`.
- DPRC should also be cross-linked to the general Events / News context.

> **Rule:** Never remove the primary `has_*` relation when adding an `also_listed_under`. Both must coexist.

## 9. Update Rules

### Adding a New Department
1. Check if a seed entry is needed (it shouldn't be — departments are dynamic).
2. Ensure the parent college entity already exists (either seeded or scraped).
3. Add `has_department` from college → department.
4. If the department has a known HOD, set `entity.attributes["hod"]`.
5. Re-run `build_knowledge_graph()` and verify with `verify_kg.py`.

### Adding a New College
1. Add a seed entry in `SEED_KTR_COLLEGES` (or the relevant campus seed list).
2. Add a `has_college` link from the campus seed.
3. If the college has sub-colleges (like Medicine), add them to `SEED_MEDICINE_SUB_COLLEGES`.
4. Re-run ingestion.

### Adding a New Directorate
1. Add it to `SEED_KTR_DIRECTORATES`.
2. Add a `has_directorate` link from the KTR campus seed.
3. If the directorate is surfaced from another page context, use `also_listed_under` where needed.
4. Do not add direct `collaborates_with` links from a directorate to a college or department.

### Adding or Reclassifying a Research Centre
1. If it is one of the institution-level research wings/centres, add it to the Research override list in `knowledge_graph.py`.
2. If the centre is explicitly owned by a college or department on the site, keep that academic parent as the primary `has_centre` owner.
3. Add Directorate of Research as `also_listed_under` for the same centre.
4. Add slug aliases if the site uses abbreviations, alternate spellings, or department-style URLs.

### Modeling Collaboration
1. Use `collaborates_with` only between lower-order entities such as centres, labs, events, and programs.
2. Never add `collaborates_with` directly between `directorate`, `college`, or `department`.
3. Represent higher-order collaboration by linking both higher-order entities to the same lower-order node.
4. Any higher-order collaboration report should be derived from shared lower-order nodes, not persisted in the KG.

### Adding a Research Section Page
1. Map the page to a stable canonical node in the Research override rules.
2. Use the closest existing entity type (`misc` or `publication`) rather than inventing a duplicate node from each URL variant.
3. Attach it to Directorate of Research via `also_listed_under`.

### Updating HOD / Dean names
- These come from scraped content. Re-run ingestion — the scraper will pick up the updated name from the page.
- If a page is not being scraped, update `entity.attributes["hod"]` directly in `knowledge_graph.json` as a temporary fix.

### Adding New Programs
- Programs are fully dynamic. Re-run ingestion after the program page appears on the website.
- Fees, eligibility, and criteria are stored in `program.attributes["fees"]`, `program.attributes["eligibility"]`, `program.attributes["criteria"]`.

## 10. Future: Visual KG Editor

> 📌 **Planned — Not yet implemented**

Because the SRMIST website structure is not consistently machine-readable, an automated scraper alone cannot always produce a correct graph. A visual editor will be built to address this:

### Planned Features
- Drag-and-drop node creation and linking
- Node type selector (all 12 entity types with color coding)
- Relation type picker with validation (e.g., prevent `has_college` from a `department`)
- Edit entity attributes (name, HOD, dean, fees, eligibility)
- Import/export of `knowledge_graph.json`
- Diff view to compare auto-built vs manually edited graph
- Audit log of all manual changes

### Design Principles
- Manual edits take **priority** over auto-built links
- The builder must respect a `manual_override: true` flag on entities/relations
- The visual editor should be a standalone web app (built on top of `viz.html`)
